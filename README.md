# Zorak v2.0

ZorakBot is the House bot of the Practical Python discord server.

Its purpose is to moderate, log, and provide necessary features that the community deems worthy. 
Anyone from our community is welcome to join us in developing the bot. 
Zorak uses Discord.py with cogged commands, listeners and events. 
All of this is wrapped tightly around a Postgres Database.
